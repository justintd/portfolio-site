          Hey there! I&apos;m Justin, a front-end developer based in Southern California.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 text-xl text-white font-sans">
          I originally started my career in IT as a Systems Administrator for over four years, and
          eventually found my way into having a newfound passion for web development. I decided to
          pursue being a software engineer as a career path, and after many hours of learning
          through documentation, courses, and books â€” I eventually landed my first contract position
          with iGrad through Upwork.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 text-xl text-white font-sans">
          My goals are to provide amazing user experiences with a performant, responsive front-end,
          and translating designs into pixel-perfect user interface.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 text-xl text-white font-sans">
          When I&apos;m not hacking away at code, I enjoy gaming with friends, traveling, and
          spending time with my lovely dogs.
