            Hey there! I&apos;m Justin, a front-end developer based in Southern California.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-md lg:text-xl text-white font-sans">
            I originally started my career in IT as a Systems Administrator for over four years, and
            eventually found my way into having a newfound passion for web development. I decided to
            pursue being a software engineer as a career path, and after many hours of learning
            through documentation, courses, and books â€” I eventually landed my first contract
            position with iGrad through Upwork.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-md lg:text-xl text-white font-sans">
            My goals are to provide amazing user experiences with a performant, responsive
            front-end, and translating designs into pixel-perfect user interface.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-md lg:text-xl text-white font-sans">
            When I&apos;m not hacking away at code, I enjoy gaming with friends, traveling, and
            spending time with my lovely dogs.
